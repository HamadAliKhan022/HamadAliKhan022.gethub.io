# Hamad Ali Khan | Personal Portfolio

**Live Demo:** [hamad-portfolio-liard.vercel.app](https://hamad-portfolio-liard.vercel.app)  
**Repository:** [HamadAliKhan022.gethub.io](https://github.com/HamadAliKhan022/HamadAliKhan022.gethub.io)

## 0x01. Project Overview

This repository hosts my professional portfolio, which has been migrated from a legacy static stack to a modern **Next.js 14** application. It serves as a centralized hub for my work in AI research, machine learning systems, and software engineering.

The project is architected for maximum performance, SEO visibility, and scalability. It features:
- **AI Research Projects**: Detailed documentation of my explorations in artificial intelligence.
- **Machine Learning Systems**: Deep dives into model architectures and data pipelines.
- **SpineVision AI**: A flagship case study on computer vision and medical imaging architecture.
- **Technical Blogs**: A custom-built blog system for engineering deep dives.
- **Engineering Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of system designs and experiments.

## 0x02. Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (PostCSS 4)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4
- **SEO & Indexing**: Google Search Console, Dynamic Sitemap (Next.js Metadata API), Robots.txt

## 0x03. Key Features

- **Production-Grade SEO**: Structured metadata architecture with dynamic XML sitemap and robots.txt generation.
- **Verified Visibility**: Integrated Google Search Console verification via metadata routes.
- **Atomic Architecture**: Component-driven development for high reusability and maintainability.
- **Responsive & Accessible UI**: Fluid layouts supporting Dark and Light modes with high-contrast accessibility overrides.
- **High-Performance Rendering**: Optimized Core Web Vitals with static and dynamic generation where appropriate.
- **Technical Blog System**: Purpose-built for code-heavy articles with high-contrast typography and semantic structure.

## 0x04. Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture for clarity and separation of concerns:

- **/app**: Core application logic, routing, and metadata routes (sitemap/robots).
- **/components**: Reusable UI primitives and section-based components.
- **/lib**: Shared utilities, metadata generators, and custom hooks.
- **/public**: Static assets, including site graphics and favicons.
- **/archive_static**: Preserved legacy HTML/CSS/JS version for historical reference during migration.

## 0x05. Performance & SEO

Emphasis was placed on ensuring the site is easily discoverable and performs optimally:
- **Core Web Vitals**: Minimized bundle sizes and optimized asset loading for near-perfect Lighthouse scores.
- **Structured Metadata**: Fine-grained control over Open Graph, Twitter cards, and canonical tags.
- **Sitemap Generation**: Automated indexing of all static and dynamic routes.
- **Crawlability**: Strategic robots.txt configuration and semantic HTML5 layout.

## 0x06. Deployment

The application is deployed on **Vercel**, benefiting from a CI/CD pipeline that automatically triggers production builds upon every push to the `main` branch. This ensures a stable and continuously updated environment.

## 0x07. Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Admin-Only CMS**: Implementation of a persistent dashboard for direct content management.
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Integration of custom server-side monitoring for deeper user insights.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Role-based access control for private content management.
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of runtime errors and latency.
- [ ] **Blog Expansion**: Scaling the technical blog to include interactive AI demonstrations.

## 0x08. Contribution Note

During the migration and development phases, commits were structured using an **atomic methodology**. This approach ensures a clean, traceable Git history where each change is deliberate, documented, and contributes to a robust contribution graph.
